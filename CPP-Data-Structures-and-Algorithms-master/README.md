# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms
This is the code repository for [C++ Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788835213), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
C++ is a general-purpose programming language which has evolved over the years and is used to develop software for many different sectors. This book will be your companion as it takes you through implementing classic data structures and algorithms to help you get up and running as a confident C++ programmer.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All code files are present in their respective folder.

The code will look like the following:
```
// in_out.cpp
#include <iostream>
  int main ()
  {
     int i;
     std::cout << "Please enter an integer value: ";
     std::cin >> i;
     std::cout << "The value you entered is " << i;
     std::cout << "\n";
     return 0;
   }
```

To get through this book and successfully complete all the source code examples, you will
need the following specifications:
* Desktop PC or Notebook with Windows, Linux, or macOS
* GNU GCC v5.4.0 or above
* Code::Block IDE v17.12 (for Windows and Linux OS) or Code::Block IDE v13.12
